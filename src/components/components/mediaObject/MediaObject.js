                    <p>Standing on the frontline when the bombs start to fall. Heaven is jealous of our love, angels are crying from up above. Can't replace you with a million rings. Boy, when you're with me I'll give you a taste. There’s no going back. Before you met me I was alright but things were kinda heavy. Heavy is the head that wears the crown.</p>

                        <p>Greetings loved ones let's take a journey. Yes, we make angels cry, raining down on earth from up above. Give you something good to celebrate. I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath. I'm ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans. As I march alone to a different beat. Summer after high school when we first met. You're so hypnotizing, could you be the devil? Could you be an angel? It's time to bring out the big balloons. Thought that I was the exception. Bikinis, zucchinis, Martinis, no weenies.</p>

                <p>I know there will be sacrifice but that's the price. Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock? Be your teenage dream tonight. Uh-huh, I see you. There’s no going back. Yeah, we maxed our credit cards and got kicked out of the bar. So let me get you in your birthday suit. You may fall in love when you meet her. Had the world in the palm of your hands. Don't let the greatness get you down, oh, oh yeah. Now we talking astrology, getting our nails did, all Japanese-y. Make me your Aphrodite.</p>

      <p>All my girls vintage Chanel baby. So you can have your cake. Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air. Slowly swallowing down my fear, yeah yeah. Growing fast into a bolt of lightning. So hot and heavy, 'Til dawn. That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor. Heavy is the head that wears the crown.</p>

        <p>Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed. Cause once you’re mine, once you’re mine. Be your teenage dream tonight. Heavy is the head that wears the crown. It's not even a holiday, nothing to celebrate. A perfect storm, perfect storm.</p>
